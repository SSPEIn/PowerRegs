		 Illustration:
			 An application for scheduling a transaction on 25th day of a month, shall be processed on first-come-first-served basis only if such application is received till 21st day of that month.

	Procedure for scheduling of transactions in a contingency
	13.  In the event of a contingency, the buying utility may locate a source of power to meet short-term contingency requirement even after the cut-off time of 1500 hrs of the preceding day and apply to the nodal agency for open access and scheduling and in that event, the nodal agency shall endeavour to accommodate such request as soon as and to the extent practically feasible, in accordance with the detailed procedure.
	
	Revision of Schedule
	14.	(1)  The open access schedules accepted by the nodal agency in advance and on first-come-first-served basis may be cancelled or revised downwards by the applicant by giving a minimum five (5) days’ notice, excluding the day on which notice is served and the day from which revised schedules are to be implemented.
		(2)  The applicant shall continue to be liable to pay transmission charges as per the schedule originally approved, if the period of revision or cancellation is up to five (5) days.
		(3)  If the period of revision or cancellation exceeds five (5) days, transmission charges for the period beyond five (5) days shall be payable in accordance with the revised schedule and for the first five days (5) in accordance with the original schedule.
		(4)  In case of cancellation, operating charges shall be payable for five (5) days or the period of cancellation in days, which ever is less.
	
	Curtailment in case of transmission constraints
	15.	(1)  When for the reason of transmission constraints or to maintain grid security, it becomes necessary to curtail power flow on a transmission corridor, the transactions already scheduled may be curtailed in the manner decided by the Regional Load Despatch Centre, if in its opinion such curtailment is likely to relieve the transmission constraint or is likely to improve grid security.
		(2)  In case of inter-regional bilateral transactions, approved schedule may be revised or cancelled by the Regional Load Despatch Centre, if the Central Government allocates power from a central generating station in one region to a person in the other region and such allocation, in the opinion of the Regional Load Despatch Centre, cannot otherwise be implemented because of congestion in inter-regional link. The intimation about such revision or cancellation shall, as soon as possible, be conveyed to the affected open access customers.
		(3)  In case of curtailment of the approved schedule by the Regional Load Despatch Centre, transmission charges shall be payable pro-rata in accordance with the curtailed schedule: Provided that operating charges shall not be revised in case of curtailment.
